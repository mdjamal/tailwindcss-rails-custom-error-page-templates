# Tailwind CSS Rails Custom Error Page Templates
These are set of HTML templates built as a replacement for default Ruby on Rails error page templates, found in Rails app /*public*/ folder.

The default error pages especially the 404 page leaves me confused or even alarmed when I see them as something has broken and that we are stuck. 

![Default vs Custom](https://github.com/mdjamal/tailwindcss-rails-custom-error-page-templates/raw/master/screenshots/default-vs-custom.jpg) 

So have designed these error pages 404, 422 and 500 and will be using them for all my rails project.

It â€™s simple HMTL code and looks stunning thanks to awesome [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and beautiful illustrations by [Ouch.pics](https://icons8.com) 

Included 3 styles in folder titled after CSS position [*Static*](#static), [*Static-Illustrated*](#static-illustrated) and [*Absolute*](#absolute).

To use just copy the style you like and replace the error pages in your Rails app /*public*/ folder. The HTML uses TailwindCSS CDN., to keep it simple portable and not worry about Rails Asset Pipeline. 

## Static
A very simple and normal layout with elements stacked.

## Static Illustrated
Similar to static but uses illustration instead of the error codes.

## Absolute
The elements are layered on top using the absolute position in wide screens and stacked in small screens.
