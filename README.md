# Tailwind CSS Rails Custom Error Page Templates
These are set of HTML templates built as a replacement for default Ruby on Rails error page templates, found in Rails app ::public:: folder.

The default error pages especially 404 page leaves me confused or even alarmed when I see them, like something has broken and that we are stuck. 

So have designed these error pages 404, 422 and 500 and will be using them for all my rails project.

It â€™s simple HMTL code and looks stunning thanks to awesome [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and beautiful illustrations by [Ouch.pics](https://icons8.com) 

Included 3 styles in folder titled after CSS position [*Static*](#static), [*Static-Illustrated*](#static-illustrated) and [*Absolute*](#absolute).

To use just copy the style you like and replace the error pages in your Rails app  ::public:: folder. The HTML uses TailwindCSS CDN., to keep it simple portable and not worry about Rails Asset Pipeline. 

## Static
A very simple and normal layout with elements stacked.

## Static Illustrated
Similar to static but uses illustration instead of the error codes.

## Absolute
The elements are layered on top using absolute position in wide screens and stacked in small screens.
